# TUnit Instructions

TUnit is a modern testing framework for .NET applications. We're using it to write and run unit tests for our codebase. This document provides instructions on how to set up, write, and run tests using TUnit.

## Usage

**ALWAYS** use #github/github-mcp-server/* and check the [Documentation Sources](#documentation-sources) section for the latest information (if you haven't already) when:

- Setting up TUnit in your project
- Writing new tests
- Running tests
- Troubleshooting issues
